    "more": "This 2‐mode network comprises 84 nodes of the node type ‘tombs’ and 270 nodes of the node type ‘persons’. From all tombs included into the network, there are only six tombs that cannot be related to a person, which means that their owners remain anonymous. With these exceptions all of the tomb nodes are connected to at least one person. To be able to distinguish between tomb owners and other individuals attested in the same tomb, the owner is represented by a bigger node. From all tombs included to the network 57% are connected to only one person, while 36 tombs show edges to more than one individual. Until now, 84 of those so‐called elite tombs, whose physical existence is known or has been recorded in the past, could be included to the present case study. Within the network they are represented as green nodes. An overview of the whole tomb network shows that the majority of tomb nodes are depicted as isolated dots within the space of the Memphite necropolis. But a closer look reveals that there are at least six tombs that form pairs. This phenomenon is based on the fact that persons are attested in more than one tomb. For example, the goldsmith Amenemone is mentioned in Maya’s tomb, where he held the title jdn.w nA n.w Hmw.w.w (n.j) pr HD n.j pr aA: deputy of the craftsmen of the treasury. His own tomb chapel has been discovered in the Teti-cemetery. Within the wall decoration of his tomb all individuals, except for his family members, remain generic and do not show a name label. Amenemone’s son Ptahmose is shown and named as sXA.w pr HD: scribe of the treasury within the tomb of his father. An inscription in the tomb of Maya names a person of the same name bearing the titles jdn.w n.j jm.j-rA pr HD: deputy of the overseer of the treasury and sXA.w Sa.t jm.j-rA pr.wj HD: secretary of the overseer of the treasury. Taking into consideration that both persons are identical would mean the tomb complexes of Maya and Amenemone might be connected to each other, although they are located some distance from each other.",
